Using Power BI to proceed to a further analysis of Electric Vehicles sold in Europe.
In this one I tried to show the evolution of EV cars sales across Europe overtime, as well as a chart showing the % of cars sold per country compared to Europe
The report also allows to search a particular year, to view which country performed best on that particular year
